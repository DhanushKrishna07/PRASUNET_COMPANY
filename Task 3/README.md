This is task 3 of Prasunet Company | Data Science Domain.

Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. Use a dataset such as the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

 🏦 Enhancing Customer Deposit Predictions with Decision Trees 💵 
 
Delved into customer deposit predictions using the bank dataset. Utilized Decision Trees to uncover insights, enhanced model accuracy with pruning techniques, and visualized the decision-making process.

Project Highlights:

•Built and trained a Decision Tree model to predict customer deposits.
•Enhanced the model using pruning to prevent overfitting.
•Achieved and compared accuracy before and after pruning.
•Visualized both the initial and pruned Decision Trees for better interpretability.

Steps Involved:

• Imported essential libraries for data manipulation and visualization.
• Loaded the dataset containing customer information.
• Preprocessed the data by dropping the target column and applying one-hot encoding to categorical variables.
• Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
• Built and trained the initial Decision Tree classifier.
• Made predictions and calculated accuracy for the initial model.
• Visualized the initial Decision Tree to understand its structure.
• Created and trained a pruned Decision Tree classifier to enhance performance.
• Made predictions and calculated accuracy for the pruned model.
• Visualized the pruned Decision Tree to compare with the initial model.

Key Takeaway:

Pruning significantly enhances the performance of a Decision Tree model by reducing overfitting, resulting in more accurate predictions and clearer insights into customer deposit behavior.
